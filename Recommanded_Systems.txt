Types of Recommender Systems are:-

1) Content Based :- 
--- On the similarities of the content basically through tags.
Start-ups companies do on the content based machine learning.
2) Collaborative Filtering :-
--- On the basics of user similarities the content is been shared.
For ex- if user A has watched the movie M1 and same movie is watched by user 2 and both love that movie that means they have similarities in them so now if user 1 watched movie M2 that means and he/she likes the movie so the same movie can be recommended to user 2 as we know that both have same similarities in them.

Basically the small companies do collaborative filtering kind of machine learning.

3) Hybrid :-
--- This is nothing a mixture of both Content based and Collaborative filtering as now big companies follow this thing.

As 5 year's ago "Youtube" is based on Content based but now it's based on hybrid based as which movie i like they will recommended that as well as the user who like your type of movie is also recommended in your feed.
